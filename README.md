# BudgetBuddy – SWE Project (CSCI 370)

BudgetBuddy is a simple financial awareness tool designed to help users pause and rethink impulse spending. Instead of tracking purchases after they happen, the app shows the *real cost* of a purchase before buying by converting prices into work hours and showing how each decision affects personal financial goals.

## Project Summary

BudgetBuddy reduces impulse spending by introducing a moment of reflection at the point of purchase.  
The system uses work-hour conversion, goal impact visualizations, simple nudges, and streak tracking to help users make smarter financial decisions.
